# Womens Football

I have a passion for football and data analytics, so why not combine the two!
This repository is where I will share data, analysis and code as I continue my journey learning Python with a focus on Women's Football.

Data has been sourced from a number of places, but I've found FBref (https://fbref.com/en/) a really good starting point.

Notebooks can be found here Notebooks:

**WSL 2023-24 Season Data Analysis.ipynb** - Initial data analysis conducted on a snapshot of WSL data from the 2023/24 season (as at March 2024). Contains calculations (e.g. penalty conversion rate, WSL players by age group) and a range of visualisations, including pie chart, bar chart and box plots.

**WSL Web Scraping Example.ipynb** - An example web scrap (FBref - WSL stats) to return the current WSL league table and associated high-level statistics. Table then used to highlight the WSL team with the highest attendance in 2023/24 season.

**WSL Teams xG 2023-24.ipynb** - Using an xG data to create a scatterplot of xG For and xG Against for each of the 12 WSL teams

**WSL Stacked Bar Plot Matplotlib WSL Top 4.ipynb** - Creating a stacked bar chart to show the WSL Top 4 (Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United) results in terms of wins, draws and losses
